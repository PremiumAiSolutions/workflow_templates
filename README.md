# Workflow Templates for Mcp Assistants

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive set of templates for implementing, configuring, and documenting AI-driven assistants and operational workflows based on the Master Control Program (Mcp) architecture. These templates provide standardized documentation and configuration structures to ensure consistent implementation across your AI systems.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```

└── workflow_templates/        # Templates directory
    ├── main_assistant/        # Central orchestrator
    ├── mcp_thinking_agent/    # Decision-making agent
    ├── mcp_email_no_human/    # Automated email system
    ├── mcp_email_human_in_loop/
    └── [additional templates...]
```

The templates are organized into the following categories:

**Core Assistants:**
- `main_assistant/` - Central orchestrator that delegates tasks to other specialized assistants
- `mcp_thinking_agent/` - Decision-making agent that determines which specialized assistant to use

**Communication Assistants:**
- `mcp_email_no_human/` - Fully automated email sending for templated communications
- `mcp_email_human_in_loop/` - Email handling with human review/approval steps
- `mcp_calendar/` - Handles scheduling and calendar management
- `mcp_receptionist/` - Handles incoming communications and routing
- `mcp_dispatch/` - Routes tasks to appropriate resources or people

**Process Assistants:**
- `mcp_scrape/` - Web scraping and data extraction
- `mcp_invoice/` - Invoice generation and processing
- `mcp_estimate/` - Estimate generation and management

**Workflow Processes:**
- `workflow_sms_inbound/` - Processes incoming SMS messages
- `workflow_sms_outbound/` - Manages outgoing SMS communications
- `workflow_add_to_knowledge_base/` - Process for adding new information to the knowledge base

**Knowledge Management:**
- `mcp_knowledge_base/` - Central repository for organizational knowledge

## Template Types

Each assistant/workflow folder contains four template types:

1. **Prompt Template** (`*_prompt_template.md`) - Defines how users or systems interact with the assistant/workflow.
   - Specifies required input variables
   - Outlines expected output formats
   - Provides example usage

2. **Configuration Template** (`*_config_template.yaml`) - Technical setup file for each assistant/workflow.
   - API connections and authentication
   - Knowledge source references
   - Operational parameters
   - Logging and monitoring settings
   - Security configurations
   - Human-in-the-loop settings (if applicable)

3. **Operational Guideline Template** (`*_operational_guideline_template.md`) - Comprehensive documentation.
   - Core purpose and identity
   - Knowledge sources
   - Task definitions
   - Communication style
   - Constraints and boundaries
   - Error handling
   - Maintenance procedures

4. **Flowchart Template** (`*_flowchart_template.md`) - Visual process diagram using Mermaid syntax.
   - Illustrates the workflow logic
   - Shows decision points
   - Maps the flow from input to output

## How to Use These Templates

### Getting Started

1. **Review the overview documents first:**
   - `docs/How to Use Your Mcp Assistant and Workflow Templates.md`
   - `docs/Workflow and Assistant Template Mapping.md`
   - `docs/Master Template Structures for Mcp Assistants and Workflows.md`

2. **Use the implementation checklist:**
   - Follow the step-by-step guide in `docs/Implementation_Checklist.md`
   - Use it to track your progress for each template implementation

3. **Start with one workflow or assistant:**
   - Choose the one most relevant to your immediate needs
   - Review all four templates in that folder to understand the complete picture

### Implementation Process

1. **Customize the Configuration file:**
   - Replace placeholder API endpoints and authentication methods
   - Connect to your actual knowledge sources and databases
   - Set appropriate operational parameters for your environment
   - Define security settings and logging configurations
   - **NEW:** Use `scripts/validate_configs.ps1` to check your configuration files

2. **Adapt the Operational Guidelines:**
   - Refine the purpose and scope to match your business needs
   - Update knowledge sources and interacting systems
   - Customize task definitions and decision-making logic
   - Define appropriate constraints for your environment

3. **Modify the Prompt Templates:**
   - Adjust input variables to match your data structures
   - Update examples to reflect your actual use cases
   - Ensure output formats integrate with your systems

4. **Use the Flowchart as implementation guide:**
   - Follow the logic flow for development
   - Ensure all decision points are implemented
   - Map error handling to actual processes
   - **NEW:** See `docs/Mermaid_Flowchart_Guide.md` for help with viewing and editing flowcharts

5. **Version control your customized templates:**
   - Track changes over time
   - Document modifications for team collaboration

## Best Practices

- **Start small:** Implement one assistant/workflow before moving to the next
- **Maintain consistency:** Follow the established patterns across implementations
- **Customize thoughtfully:** Adapt to your needs while preserving the template structure
- **Review regularly:** Update templates as your systems evolve
- **Documentation is key:** Keep the operational guidelines current and comprehensive
- **Validate your work:** Use the provided validation script to ensure correctness
- **Platform compatibility:** Adapt paths and settings for your specific OS (Windows/Linux/Mac)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while implementing these templates:
