# Workflow Templates Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure you've properly implemented each workflow template. Work through these items systematically for each assistant or workflow you implement.

## Initial Setup

- [ ] **Select workflow/assistant to implement**
  - [ ] Review all four templates in the selected directory
  - [ ] Understand the purpose and flow of the workflow/assistant
  - [ ] Identify dependencies and integrations needed

- [ ] **Set up development environment**
  - [ ] Install necessary tools and languages
  - [ ] Set up version control
  - [ ] Configure development environment

- [ ] **Install validation tools**
  - [ ] Set up PowerShell with powershell-yaml module if using the validation script
  - [ ] Install VS Code with Mermaid extension or another Markdown viewer

## Configuration Template Implementation

- [ ] **Replace placeholder API endpoints**
  - [ ] Update all endpoints with actual service URLs
  - [ ] Replace `http://mcp-*-service` style URLs with real service endpoints
  - [ ] Remove example comments that don't apply to your implementation

- [ ] **Configure authentication**
  - [ ] Set up environment variables for API keys and credentials
  - [ ] Document the required environment variables
  - [ ] Update the `api_key_env_var` fields with your actual environment variable names

- [ ] **Set appropriate paths**
  - [ ] Replace Unix-style paths (`/var/log/`) with appropriate Windows paths (`C:\logs\`) if on Windows
  - [ ] Update all placeholder paths (`/path/to/...`) with actual file system locations
  - [ ] Create necessary directories for logs and data storage

- [ ] **Customize workflow parameters**
  - [ ] Adjust rate limits to match your system capabilities
  - [ ] Set appropriate timeout values
  - [ ] Configure retry attempts based on service reliability

- [ ] **Update security settings**
  - [ ] Define proper role-based access controls
  - [ ] Configure encryption settings
  - [ ] Set up appropriate logging levels

- [ ] **Validate configuration**
  - [ ] Run the validation script (`scripts/validate_configs.ps1`)
  - [ ] Fix any errors or warnings
  - [ ] Test loading the configuration in your application

## Operational Guidelines Implementation

- [ ] **Update identity information**
  - [ ] Set the correct version and last updated date
  - [ ] Assign proper owner/team information
  - [ ] Define realistic KPIs for your environment

- [ ] **Configure knowledge sources**
  - [ ] Replace placeholder links with actual documentation URLs
  - [ ] Update references to knowledge repositories
  - [ ] Link to your actual systems documentation

- [ ] **Customize tasks and responsibilities**
  - [ ] Adapt task descriptions to your specific implementation
  - [ ] Add any additional tasks specific to your environment
  - [ ] Remove tasks that don't apply to your use case

- [ ] **Specify error handling procedures**
  - [ ] Update error codes to match your actual system
  - [ ] Define proper escalation paths with real contact information
  - [ ] Document specific error resolution steps

- [ ] **Define maintenance procedures**
  - [ ] Set realistic update frequency
  - [ ] Add actual contact information for responsible teams
  - [ ] Establish monitoring and review processes

## Prompt Template Implementation

- [ ] **Adapt input variables**
  - [ ] Update variable descriptions for your specific use case
  - [ ] Add or remove variables based on your implementation
  - [ ] Replace example values with relevant examples for your system

- [ ] **Refine expected outputs**
  - [ ] Update output format descriptions
  - [ ] Ensure output examples match your actual implementation
  - [ ] Add any additional output details specific to your system

- [ ] **Create actual examples**
  - [ ] Replace generic examples with specific use cases for your organization
  - [ ] Ensure examples cover common scenarios your users will encounter
  - [ ] Test examples to verify they work as expected

## Flowchart Implementation

- [ ] **Render and review flowchart**
  - [ ] Use VS Code with Mermaid extension or online Mermaid editor
  - [ ] Verify all connections are logical and correct
  - [ ] Ensure graph renders properly

- [ ] **Customize flowchart elements**
  - [ ] Replace all placeholder text (items in `{{brackets}}`)
  - [ ] Add or remove nodes to match your actual implementation
  - [ ] Update decision paths to reflect your business logic

- [ ] **Test flowchart accuracy**
  - [ ] Walk through each path in the flowchart
  - [ ] Verify it matches your actual implementation
  - [ ] Update any discrepancies between the diagram and reality

## Integration and Testing

- [ ] **Develop integration points**
  - [ ] Implement API clients for each service integration
  - [ ] Create data models for information exchange
  - [ ] Set up message queues or event triggers

- [ ] **Implement error handling**
  - [ ] Add retry logic for transient failures
  - [ ] Create proper logging for errors
  - [ ] Establish alerting for critical failures

- [ ] **Test workflow execution**
  - [ ] Create test cases for happy paths
  - [ ] Test error handling and edge cases
  - [ ] Verify proper escalation when needed

- [ ] **Perform security review**
  - [ ] Scan for hardcoded credentials
  - [ ] Verify proper access controls
  - [ ] Ensure sensitive data is properly handled

## Deployment and Documentation

- [ ] **Prepare for deployment**
  - [ ] Set up environment-specific configurations
  - [ ] Create deployment scripts or pipelines
  - [ ] Establish backup and rollback procedures

- [ ] **Document implementation**
  - [ ] Update implementation notes with specific details
  - [ ] Create user guides if applicable
  - [ ] Document troubleshooting procedures

- [ ] **Conduct final review**
  - [ ] Verify all placeholders have been replaced
  - [ ] Ensure no example or placeholder text remains
  - [ ] Check that all paths, URLs, and credentials are set correctly

- [ ] **Deploy to production**
