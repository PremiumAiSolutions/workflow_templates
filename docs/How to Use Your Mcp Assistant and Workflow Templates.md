# How to Use Your Mcp Assistant and Workflow Templates

This guide provides instructions on how to effectively use the set of templates created for your Mcp (Master Control Program) assistants and company workflows. These templates are designed to help you structure, configure, document, and visualize your AI-driven operational components.

## 1. Understanding the Provided Files and Structure

You have received the following key items:

*   **`workflow_templates.zip`**: This archive contains individual folders for each of the 14 Mcp assistants and workflows you listed. Within each folder, you will find four distinct template files:
    *   A Prompt Template (`*_prompt_template.md`)
    *   A Configuration Template (`*_config_template.yaml`)
    *   An Operational Guideline Template (`*_operational_guideline_template.md`)
    *   A Flowchart Template (`*_flowchart_template.md`)
*   **`master_template_structures.md`**: This document explains the general sections, purpose, and intended content for each of the four template types. It is highly recommended to review this first to understand the design philosophy behind the templates.
*   **`workflow_template_mapping.md`**: This file provides a quick reference, listing all the workflows/assistants and the corresponding set of four templates created for each. This can help you easily locate specific templates within the zip archive.

## 2. How to Use Each Template Type

Here’s a breakdown of each template type and how to utilize it:

### a. Prompt Templates

*   **Filename Convention:** `[assistant_or_workflow_name]_prompt_template.md`
*   **Purpose:** These Markdown files provide structured examples of how users (humans) or other systems (e.g., another Mcp assistant) can interact with or trigger a specific Mcp assistant or workflow. They clearly define the expected input variables (what information needs to be provided) and the desired output format (what response or action to expect).
*   **How to Use:**
    *   **User Interface Design:** If an Mcp assistant has a direct user interface, use these prompt templates as a basis for designing the input fields and understanding the data that needs to be collected from the user.
    *   **System-to-System Integration:** For automated interactions where one Mcp calls another or triggers a workflow, these templates define the API request payload structure and the expected response structure. This ensures clear communication between your AI components.
    *   **Customization:** Adapt the example inputs, variables, and expected outputs detailed in these templates to match your specific use cases, data fields, and interaction patterns.
    *   **Development Guide:** Provide these to developers who are building the interfaces or integrations for these Mcp assistants.

### b. Configuration Templates

*   **Filename Convention:** `[assistant_or_workflow_name]_config_template.yaml`
*   **Purpose:** These YAML files are critical for the technical setup and operational parameters of each Mcp assistant or workflow. They contain settings for API integrations (endpoints, authentication methods), links to knowledge bases or data sources, workflow-specific parameters (e.g., thresholds, default values), trigger conditions, logging configurations, security settings, and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) parameters.
*   **How to Use:**
    *   **System Setup:** This is where you will input your company’s actual system details. Replace placeholder values (e.g., `YOUR_API_ENDPOINT_HERE`, `API_KEY_ENV_VAR_NAME`) with real, operational data. For sensitive information like API keys, it is strongly recommended to use environment variables or a secure secrets management system, as suggested in the templates, rather than hardcoding them.
    *   **Deployment:** These configuration files are designed to be potentially consumable by your AI/automation platform (such as your AirQ OS or a custom orchestration engine). Your platform can read these YAML files to deploy, manage, and dynamically configure each Mcp instance.
    *   **Operational Tuning:** Adjust parameters like confidence thresholds, retry attempts, or default behaviors based on performance and operational needs.
    *   **Version Control:** Keep these configuration files under version control to track changes and manage different environments (development, staging, production).
    *   **Regular Review:** As your internal systems, external APIs, or business requirements evolve, revisit and update these configuration files to ensure they remain accurate.

### c. Operational Guideline Templates

*   **Filename Convention:** `[assistant_or_workflow_name]_operational_guideline_template.md`
*   **Purpose:** These Markdown documents serve as comprehensive instruction manuals or charters for each Mcp assistant or workflow. They meticulously define its core purpose, the knowledge sources it relies on, its primary tasks and responsibilities, its defined communication style (if applicable), its operational constraints and boundaries (very important for defining what the AI *should not* do – the "obstructions"), error handling procedures, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) escalation criteria, and maintenance guidelines.
*   **How to Use:**
    *   **Internal Documentation:** Use these as the primary source of truth for understanding what each Mcp component does, how it is designed to work, and its specific limitations. This is invaluable for your team.
    *   **Training & Onboarding:** Excellent for training new team members involved in managing, developing, or interacting with your AI systems.
    *   **Troubleshooting & Maintenance:** When issues arise or updates are planned for an Mcp, refer to its operational guideline to understand its intended behavior and dependencies.
    *   **Governance & Compliance:** Helps ensure consistent understanding, management, and governance of each AI component, which is crucial as your system scales in complexity.
    *   **Defining AI Behavior:** The "Constraints & Boundaries (Obstructions)" section is particularly vital for clearly outlining what the AI is prohibited from doing, helping to ensure safe and responsible operation.

### d. Flowchart Templates

*   **Filename Convention:** `[assistant_or_workflow_name]_flowchart_template.md`
*   **Purpose:** These Markdown files use Mermaid syntax to provide a visual representation of the process flow or decision logic for each Mcp assistant or workflow.
*   **How to Use:**
    *   **Process Visualization:** Use them to clearly understand the step-by-step operations and decision points within each component.
    *   **Team Collaboration:** Excellent for facilitating discussions among team members (technical and non-technical) about how a workflow operates.
    *   **Onboarding & Training:** Helps new team members quickly grasp the logic of complex processes.
    *   **Process Improvement:** By visualizing the flow, you can more easily identify potential bottlenecks, redundancies, or areas for optimization.
    *   **Rendering:** To view the actual flowchart diagram, you can use any Markdown editor or online tool that supports Mermaid syntax (e.g., the Mermaid Live Editor, many IDEs with Markdown preview extensions, or documentation platforms like GitLab/GitHub).

## 3. General Approach to Implementation and Usage

1.  **Start with a Single Workflow/Assistant:** Don’t try to tackle everything at once. Select one of your key Mcp assistants or workflows to begin with (e.g., the "Main Assistant (Office Manager)" or "Mcp Email - No Human in Loop").
2.  **Holistic Review:** For the chosen component, review all four of its templates (Prompt, Configuration, Operational Guideline, and Flowchart) together. This will provide a complete picture of its design and intended operation.
3.  **Prioritize Configuration:** The **Configuration Template (.yaml)** will require the most immediate and detailed customization with your specific system details (API endpoints, credentials, paths, etc.). This is essential for making the Mcp operational.
4.  **Customize Operational Guidelines:** Adapt the **Operational Guideline Template (.md)** to reflect any specific nuances of your business processes, data handling policies, or desired AI behaviors for that component. Pay close attention to the "Constraints" section.
5.  **Adapt Prompts:** Refine the **Prompt Template (.md)** to match the exact input data you will be providing and the precise output you expect for your use cases.
6.  **Understand the Flow:** Use the **Flowchart Template (.md)** to confirm your understanding of the process and to explain it to others.
7.  **Iterate and Refine:** These templates are designed to be living documents. As you implement, test, and operate your Mcp assistants and workflows, you will likely identify areas for improvement or further customization. Update the templates accordingly.
8.  **Version Control:** It is highly recommended to store all these customized templates in a version control system (like Git) to track changes, collaborate with your team, and manage different versions if needed.

**Example: Setting up your "Mcp Calendar" Assistant**

1.  **Read:** Open and read the `mcp_calendar_operational_guideline_template.md` to fully understand its intended functions, tasks, knowledge sources, and limitations.
2.  **Configure:** Edit the `mcp_calendar_config_template.yaml`. Fill in your actual calendar API integration details (e.g., Google Calendar API, Microsoft Graph API), connections to your user database (if it needs to look up attendees), default meeting settings (e.g., default duration, video conferencing links), and any specific business rules for scheduling.
3.  **Define Interaction:** Review and adapt the `mcp_calendar_prompt_template.md`. This will guide how other systems (like the Main Assistant) or users will make requests to create, update, or query calendar events. Ensure the input variables match what your system can provide and the output format is what the calling system expects.
4.  **Visualize Logic:** Open the `mcp_calendar_flowchart_template.md` (using a Mermaid-compatible viewer) to see the step-by-step process the Mcp Calendar assistant will follow, from receiving a request to interacting with the calendar API and confirming the action.

By following this structured approach, these templates will serve as a robust foundation for building, managing, and scaling your company’s AI-driven workflows and Mcp assistants effectively and consistently.
