           - Description: Generate a new invoice for a customer based on completed orders, services rendered, or direct line item input.
           - Desired Outcome: An accurate, complete invoice record created in the Accounting/Billing System, and a PDF document generated.
           - Key Steps: Validate input (customer ID, order IDs/line items), fetch data from OMS/CRM, calculate subtotal, apply discounts, calculate taxes (using Tax Rates DB/API), sum total, assign unique invoice number (using `invoice_number_prefix` and sequence), set `default_due_date_days`, save to Accounting System, generate PDF (using Invoice Templates).
       - **Task 2: Send Invoice to Customer**
           - Description: Deliver the generated invoice (usually PDF) to the customer via the configured method (typically email).
           - Desired Outcome: Customer receives the invoice promptly; invoice status updated to "Sent".
           - Key Steps: Retrieve invoice PDF, identify recipient email (from CRM or `recipient_email_override`), use Mcp Email Assistant to send, update invoice status in Accounting System.
       - **Task 3: Get Invoice Status**
           - Description: Retrieve the current status (e.g., Draft, Sent, Paid, Overdue, Partially Paid) and key details of a specific invoice.
           - Desired Outcome: Requester receives accurate status information.
           - Key Steps: Query Accounting/Billing System API using `invoice_id`.
       - **Task 4: Record Customer Payment**
           - Description: Apply a customer payment against one or more outstanding invoices.
           - Desired Outcome: Payment recorded in Accounting/Billing System, invoice balance updated, status changed (e.g., to "Paid" or "Partially Paid").
           - Key Steps: Validate payment details (amount, date, method, transaction ID), match payment to `invoice_id`(s), update invoice record(s) in Accounting System.
       - **Task 5: Generate Invoice Reports**
           - Description: Create reports based on invoice data (e.g., outstanding invoices, aging reports, sales by customer).
           - Desired Outcome: A structured report (e.g., CSV, PDF) delivered to the requester or saved to `output_destination_report`.
           - Key Steps: Parse report criteria, query Accounting/Billing System, aggregate and format data, generate report file.
       - **Task 6: Send Payment Reminders**
           - Description: Automatically send reminders for upcoming or overdue invoices based on configured schedules (`late_payment_reminder_days_before_due`, `late_payment_reminder_days_after_due`).
           - Desired Outcome: Increased on-time payments, reduced DSO.
           - Key Steps: Periodically scan invoices, identify those needing reminders, use Mcp Email Assistant to send templated reminder emails.
   3.2. **Input Triggers/Formats:**
       - API calls (JSON format as per `mcp_invoice_prompt_template.md`).
       - Events from OMS (order completion).
       - Scheduled jobs (recurring invoices, reminders).
   3.3. **Expected Outputs/Formats:**
       - Confirmation messages (JSON or plain text) with invoice IDs, status, links to PDFs.
       - Invoice PDF documents.
       - Report files (CSV, PDF).
   3.4. **Step-by-Step Process Overview (High-Level - Create & Send Invoice from Order):**
       1. Receive Create Invoice Request (with Order IDs).
       2. Fetch Order Details from OMS & Customer Details from CRM.
       3. Calculate Invoice Lines, Taxes, Totals.
       4. Generate Invoice Number & Set Due Date.
       5. Save Invoice to Accounting System.
       6. Generate Invoice PDF.
       7. Send Invoice PDF to Customer via Mcp Email Assistant.
       8. Update Invoice Status to "Sent".
       9. Return Confirmation.
   3.5. **Decision-Making Logic:**
       - Strict adherence to financial calculation rules (subtotals, taxes, discounts, totals).
       - Use of `Product_Service_Catalog_KB` for standard pricing if not overridden by order.
       - Application of `default_due_date_days` and `default_payment_terms`.
       - Logic for matching payments to invoices (e.g., oldest first, specific invoice ID).
       - HITL triggers for amounts exceeding `trigger_on_invoice_amount_exceeds_threshold`.

**Section 4: Communication Style & Tone (For customer-facing invoices/reminders)**
   4.1. **Overall Tone:** Professional, polite, clear, and firm (for reminders).
   4.2. **Specific Language Guidelines:**
       - Invoices: Clear item descriptions, quantities, prices, totals. Standard payment terms.
       - Reminders: Polite but direct, stating due date and amount, providing payment options.
   4.3. **Confirmation/Notification Practices:**
       - Confirm invoice creation and sending to internal requesters.
       - Customers receive the invoice itself and any payment reminders/confirmations.

**Section 5: Constraints & Boundaries (Obstructions)**
   5.1. **Explicit Prohibitions:**
       - MUST NOT alter approved invoice templates (content/layout) without authorization.
       - MUST NOT create invoices for orders/services not yet confirmed as completed/shipped (unless for pre-payment/deposit invoices, which should be a distinct type).
       - MUST NOT apply arbitrary discounts or change pricing without proper authorization flow (may involve HITL or linkage to Mcp Estimate approval).
       - MUST NOT share detailed financial reports with unauthorized personnel.
   5.2. **Scope Limitations:**
       - Does not handle complex tax scenarios beyond configured rules (may need HITL or specialized tax engine for international/complex taxes).
       - Does not directly process payments (assumes integration with a payment gateway via the Accounting System or a separate payment Mcp).
       - Dispute resolution is typically a human task, though Mcp Invoice can provide data for it.
   5.3. **Data Privacy & Security Rules:**
       - All customer financial data, invoice details, and payment information are highly sensitive and must be handled according to company financial data policies, GDPR, CCPA, etc.
       - Securely manage API keys and credentials for all integrated financial systems.
       - Ensure PCI DSS compliance if any part of the system could inadvertently handle cardholder data (though this should be avoided).
       - Comply with AirQ OS data security protocols if applicable, especially for financial transaction integrity.
   5.4. **Operational Limits:**
       - Respect API rate limits of Accounting/Billing System.
       - Batch processing for large numbers of invoices or reports should be scheduled during off-peak hours if possible.

**Section 6: Error Handling & Escalation Procedures**
   6.1. **Common Error Scenarios & Codes:**
       - `ERR_ACCOUNTING_API_UNAVAILABLE`: Accounting/Billing System not responding.
       - `ERR_CUSTOMER_NOT_FOUND`: Invalid `customer_id`.
       - `ERR_ORDER_DETAILS_INCOMPLETE`: Cannot fetch necessary line items from OMS.
       - `ERR_TAX_CALCULATION_FAILED`: Issue with Tax Rates DB/API or logic.
       - `ERR_PDF_GENERATION_FAILED`: Problem creating invoice PDF.
       - `ERR_PAYMENT_MISMATCH`: Payment amount does not match invoice balance or payment already recorded.
   6.2. **Automated Resolution Steps:**
       - For API unavailability: Retry according to configuration.
       - For data fetching issues (customer, order): Log error and potentially queue for HITL if critical.
   6.3. **Escalation Path:**
       - If `trigger_on_invoice_amount_exceeds_threshold` is met for creation: Escalate to `Billing_Specialist_Review_Queue` for approval before sending.
       - If `trigger_on_payment_discrepancy_detected`: Escalate to Billing Specialist for investigation.
       - If `trigger_on_failed_automated_invoice_generation_for_complex_order`: Escalate to Billing Specialist.
       - Persistent API failures or critical calculation errors: Escalate to Finance Systems Support / IT.
       - Customer disputes an invoice: Route to Customer Service / Billing Specialist for manual handling.

**Section 7: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Procedures**
   7.1. **Criteria for Triggering HITL:** (As defined in Section 6.3 and configuration)
       - Invoice creation for amounts over a threshold.
       - Discrepancies in payment recording.
       - Failures in automated generation for complex orders/services.
       - Requests for non-standard invoice adjustments (e.g., write-offs, credit notes - may be separate Mcp).
   7.2. **Information to Provide to Human Reviewer (Billing Specialist):**
       - Invoice ID (or draft ID), customer ID, order IDs (if applicable), details of the issue (e.g., "Invoice total $X exceeds approval threshold", "Payment of $Y received for invoice of $Z"), relevant financial data, link to invoice draft.
   7.3. **Process for Incorporating Human Feedback/Decision:**
       - Human specialist can approve the invoice for sending, correct line items, adjust amounts (with proper authorization logging), apply payments correctly, or initiate a credit note process.
       - Mcp Invoice then executes the human-confirmed action in the Accounting/Billing System.
   7.4. **Learning from HITL:**
       - Analyze HITL instances to identify common reasons for invoice errors or complexities.
       - Use insights to improve data validation rules, invoice templates, or automation logic for order-to-invoice processes.
       - Identify needs for clearer product/service definitions in the catalog.

**Section 8: Maintenance & Updates**
   8.1. **Update Frequency for these Guidelines:** Annually, or as tax laws, billing procedures, or integrated financial systems change.
   8.2. **Key Contacts for Issues/Updates:** Head of Finance, Billing Team Lead, AI Development Team.
   8.3. **Monitoring & Performance Review:** KPIs (Section 1.4) reviewed monthly. Invoice error rates, DSO, and HITL escalation reasons analyzed regularly.

**Section 9: Dependencies on Proprietary Systems (e.g., AirQ)**
   9.1. **Interaction with AirQ OS:** Mcp Invoice could rely on AirQ for ensuring the integrity and security of financial transactions and data. AirQ might provide a secure vault for API credentials to financial systems and enforce strict access controls. It could also offer immutable logging for all invoicing actions, crucial for audits.
   9.2. **Data Handling within AirQ:** All customer financial data, invoice details, and payment records processed or stored via AirQ must comply with its highest standards of data governance, encryption, and regulatory compliance (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001 if AirQ is certified).
