   2.3. **Key Interacting Systems/Assistants:**
       - Main Assistant (for querying and tasking updates)
       - Mcp Thinking Agent (may use KB to inform decisions)
       - All other Mcp Assistants (rely on KB for contextual information)
       - Document Parser Service (for processing new documents)
       - Vector Database Service (for storage and retrieval)
       - NLP Service (for semantic search and summarization)
       - Workflow - Add to Knowledge Base (manages ingestion triggers)
       - AirQ OS (for underlying data management and security if applicable)

**Section 3: Operational Parameters & Task Definitions**
   3.1. **Primary Tasks & Responsibilities:**
       - **Task 1: Information Retrieval (Query Processing)**
           - Description: Accept natural language queries or structured searches and return relevant information from the knowledge base.
           - Desired Outcome: Accurate, concise, and sourced answers or document lists provided to the requester.
           - Key Steps: Parse query, perform semantic/keyword search in vector DB, rank results, format response (summary, direct quote, document list), cite sources.
       - **Task 2: Content Ingestion (Adding/Updating Documents)**
           - Description: Process and index new or updated documents into the knowledge base.
           - Desired Outcome: New/updated content is parsed, vectorized, indexed, and made searchable in a timely manner.
           - Key Steps: Receive document (via upload or trigger), send to Document Parser Service, receive parsed text/metadata, generate embeddings (via NLP Service), store in Vector Database, update search index.
       - **Task 3: Content Management (Lifecycle, Versioning - Potentially Advanced)**
           - Description: Manage document versions, archive outdated information, and ensure content integrity.
           - Desired Outcome: Knowledge base remains current, accurate, and free of obsolete information.
           - Key Steps: Implement version control for documents, apply retention policies, periodically review and flag content for update/archival.
   3.2. **Input Triggers/Formats:**
       - For Querying: API calls with query text (natural language or structured JSON as per `mcp_knowledge_base_prompt_template.md`).
       - For Ingestion: Triggered by "Workflow - Add to Knowledge Base" upon new/updated document detection in staging areas or direct API calls for content submission.
   3.3. **Expected Outputs/Formats:**
       - Query Responses: JSON objects containing answers, document snippets, source links, relevance scores.
       - Ingestion Status: Confirmation of successful ingestion or error messages with details.
   3.4. **Step-by-Step Process Overview (High-Level - Query):**
       1. Receive Query Request.
       2. Pre-process Query (e.g., intent recognition, entity extraction via NLP Service).
       3. Formulate Search Strategy (keyword, semantic, hybrid).
       4. Execute Search against Vector Database.
       5. Retrieve & Rank Results.
       6. Post-process Results (e.g., summarization, answer generation via NLP Service).
       7. Format and Return Response with Citations.
   3.5. **Decision-Making Logic:**
       - Use semantic search as default, fall back to keyword or hybrid search if semantic results are poor.
       - Prioritize documents based on recency, explicit importance flags, or user-defined relevance criteria.

**Section 4: Communication Style & Tone (If assistant interacts externally/with users)**
   4.1. **Overall Tone:** Informative, factual, neutral, and precise.
   4.2. **Specific Language Guidelines:**
       - Always cite sources for information provided.
       - Clearly indicate if an answer is a summary or a direct quote.
       - Avoid speculation or providing opinions; stick to stored knowledge.
   4.3. **Confirmation/Notification Practices:**
       - For ingestion: Notify upon successful indexing or if an error occurred during processing.

**Section 5: Constraints & Boundaries (Obstructions)**
   5.1. **Explicit Prohibitions:**
       - MUST NOT provide information outside of its indexed knowledge base.
       - MUST NOT generate creative content or engage in conversational dialogue beyond fulfilling information requests.
       - MUST NOT alter source documents directly; updates should go through the ingestion workflow.
   5.2. **Scope Limitations:**
       - Limited to the content within its indexed sources.
       - Does not perform external web searches unless explicitly designed as a federated search feature (which would be a separate Mcp or capability).
   5.3. **Data Privacy & Security Rules:**
       - Enforce access controls based on user roles and document sensitivity classifications (if implemented).
       - Redact sensitive PII from search results if not authorized for the querying user (advanced feature).
       - Comply with AirQ OS data security and access protocols.
   5.4. **Operational Limits:**
       - Adhere to `default_search_results_limit` and `max_document_upload_size_mb` from configuration.
       - Manage query load to stay within performance targets.

**Section 6: Error Handling & Escalation Procedures**
   6.1. **Common Error Scenarios & Codes:**
       - `ERR_QUERY_NO_RESULTS`: No relevant information found for the query.
       - `ERR_INGESTION_FAILED`: Document could not be parsed or indexed.
       - `ERR_VECTOR_DB_UNAVAILABLE`: Backend storage service not responding.
       - `ERR_NLP_SERVICE_ERROR`: Issue with semantic processing or summarization.
   6.2. **Automated Resolution Steps:**
       - For `ERR_QUERY_NO_RESULTS`: Suggest query reformulation, broader search terms, or checking spelling.
       - For `ERR_INGESTION_FAILED`: Log error, move problematic file to a quarantine area, notify Knowledge Manager.
       - For service unavailability: Retry according to configuration, then escalate.
   6.3. **Escalation Path:**
       - Persistent service unavailability: Escalate to Information Management Team / System Admin.
       - High rate of `ERR_INGESTION_FAILED`: Escalate to Knowledge Manager for investigation.
       - User-reported consistently poor search results: Escalate to Information Management Team for relevance tuning and potential re-indexing strategy review.

**Section 7: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Procedures**
   7.1. **Criteria for Triggering HITL:**
       - Search queries yielding very low relevance scores (below `hitl_config.trigger_on_low_search_relevance_score`).
       - User explicitly flags a search result as incorrect or unhelpful.
       - Ambiguous documents flagged during ingestion requiring manual categorization or review.
   7.2. **Information to Provide to Human Reviewer (Knowledge Manager):**
       - For poor search: Original query, search results provided, user feedback (if any).
       - For ingestion issues: Document content, parsing errors, suggested categorizations.
   7.3. **Process for Incorporating Human Feedback/Decision:**
       - Human reviewer can manually curate search results for specific queries, re-categorize documents, correct metadata, or trigger re-ingestion of problematic content.
   7.4. **Learning from HITL:**
       - Use feedback on search results to fine-tune ranking algorithms or identify content gaps.
       - Improve parsing rules or pre-processing steps based on ingestion HITL instances.

**Section 8: Maintenance & Updates**
   8.1. **Update Frequency for these Guidelines:** Annually or as system architecture changes.
   8.2. **Key Contacts for Issues/Updates:** Information Management Team, Lead Data Engineer.
   8.3. **Monitoring & Performance Review:** KPIs (Section 1.4) reviewed quarterly. Search analytics (popular queries, queries with no results) reviewed monthly.

**Section 9: Dependencies on Proprietary Systems (e.g., AirQ)**
   9.1. **Interaction with AirQ OS:** Mcp Knowledge Base may leverage AirQ for secure, high-performance data storage (e.g., for the vector database or document originals) and for managing the computational resources for NLP processing and indexing. AirQ could enforce data access policies across the KB.
   9.2. **Data Handling within AirQ:** All documents, metadata, and vector embeddings stored or processed via AirQ must adhere to its data lifecycle management, encryption, and audit logging standards. AirQ might provide tools for ensuring the provenance and integrity of knowledge base content.
