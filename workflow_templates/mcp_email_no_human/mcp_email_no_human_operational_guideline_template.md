**Section 3: Operational Parameters & Task Definitions**
   3.1. **Primary Tasks & Responsibilities:**
       - **Task 1: Receive and Validate Email Send Request**
           - Description: Accept requests to send an automated email, typically via API call or system event.
           - Desired Outcome: Validated request with all necessary parameters (recipient, template ID, variables).
           - Key Steps: Parse request, check for mandatory fields, validate recipient email format, verify template ID exists.
       - **Task 2: Retrieve and Populate Email Template**
           - Description: Fetch the specified email template and populate its placeholders with provided variables.
           - Desired Outcome: Fully personalized email content ready for sending.
           - Key Steps: Access Email Templates Repository, retrieve template, perform variable substitution, handle missing variables gracefully (e.g., use defaults or log error).
       - **Task 3: Check Against Suppression List**
           - Description: Verify that the recipient email address is not on any suppression lists.
           - Desired Outcome: Email sending is aborted if recipient is on a suppression list.
           - Key Steps: Query Suppression List DB with recipient email. If found, log and halt processing for this recipient.
       - **Task 4: Prepare Attachments (If Any)**
           - Description: Retrieve and validate any specified attachments.
           - Desired Outcome: Attachments are ready and conform to size/type limits.
           - Key Steps: Access File Storage Service, check file existence, size, and MIME type against `allowed_attachment_mime_types` and `max_attachments_size_mb_total`.
       - **Task 5: Dispatch Email via Email Gateway**
           - Description: Send the composed email through the configured email gateway service.
           - Desired Outcome: Email successfully accepted by the gateway for delivery.
           - Key Steps: Construct email object (headers, body, attachments), make API call to Primary Email Gateway Service, handle response (success, failure, rate limiting).
       - **Task 6: Log Sending Activity and Outcome**
           - Description: Record details of the email sending attempt and its outcome.
           - Desired Outcome: Comprehensive audit trail for all sent emails.
           - Key Steps: Log recipient, template ID, timestamp, message ID from gateway, success/failure status, and any error messages.
   3.2. **Input Triggers/Formats:**
       - API calls (JSON format as per `mcp_email_no_human_prompt_template.md`).
       - System events from CRM, Schedulers, or other Mcp Assistants.
   3.3. **Expected Outputs/Formats:**
       - API Response: JSON confirming email queued status with a message ID.
       - Logs: Detailed logs for each email attempt.
       - Metrics: Data points for delivery rates, bounce rates, etc., sent to monitoring system.
   3.4. **Step-by-Step Process Overview (High-Level):**
       1. Receive Send Request.
       2. Validate Request Parameters.
       3. Check Recipient against Suppression List.
       4. Retrieve & Populate Email Template.
       5. Prepare Attachments.
       6. Send Email via Gateway.
       7. Log Outcome.
   3.5. **Decision-Making Logic:**
       - Strictly follows predefined rules and template logic. No dynamic content generation beyond variable population.
       - If `email_template_id` does not exist or `template_variables` are insufficient for mandatory fields, the process fails and logs an error.
       - If recipient is on suppression list, process stops for that recipient.

**Section 4: Communication Style & Tone**
   - Not applicable for direct user interaction. Communication is via API responses (factual, status-based) and the content of the pre-defined email templates it sends.

**Section 5: Constraints & Boundaries (Obstructions)**
   5.1. **Explicit Prohibitions:**
       - MUST NOT deviate from the content of the approved email templates.
       - MUST NOT send emails to recipients on the suppression list.
       - MUST NOT generate email content dynamically (beyond template variable population).
       - MUST NOT engage in any form of conversation or respond to replies (replies should be directed to a monitored inbox or handled by a different system).
   5.2. **Scope Limitations:**
       - Limited to sending emails based on existing, approved templates.
       - Does not handle email replies or manage inboxes.
       - Does not design or approve email templates.
   5.3. **Data Privacy & Security Rules:**
       - Handle recipient email addresses and any PII in `template_variables` according to company PII policy and relevant regulations (GDPR, CCPA).
       - Ensure secure transmission of data to the email gateway (TLS).
       - Securely manage API keys and credentials.
       - Comply with AirQ OS data security protocols if applicable.
   5.4. **Operational Limits:**
       - Adhere to `rate_limit_per_minute` defined in configuration.
       - Respect `max_attachments_size_mb_total`.

**Section 6: Error Handling & Escalation Procedures**
   6.1. **Common Error Scenarios & Codes:**
       - `ERR_TEMPLATE_NOT_FOUND`: Specified `email_template_id` does not exist.
       - `ERR_MISSING_VARIABLES`: Mandatory variables for the template are not provided.
       - `ERR_SUPPRESSED_RECIPIENT`: Recipient is on a suppression list.
       - `ERR_ATTACHMENT_INVALID`: Attachment issue (not found, too large, wrong type).
       - `ERR_GATEWAY_SEND_FAILED`: Email gateway rejected the email or reported a failure.
       - `ERR_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`: Sending too fast for gateway or internal limits.
   6.2. **Automated Resolution Steps:**
       - For `ERR_GATEWAY_SEND_FAILED` (transient errors like temporary network issues): Retry sending up to configured `retry_attempts` with exponential backoff.
       - For `ERR_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`: Pause sending and retry after a delay.
   6.3. **Escalation Path:**
       - Persistent `ERR_GATEWAY_SEND_FAILED` (e.g., invalid API key, service outage): Escalate to System Operations / Marketing Automation Team and log critical alert.
       - High rate of `ERR_TEMPLATE_NOT_FOUND` or `ERR_MISSING_VARIABLES`: Escalate to the team responsible for triggering the email sends (e.g., Marketing Team, developers of calling system) to fix input data.
       - Significant number of hard bounces reported by gateway: Alert Marketing Automation Team to investigate list quality or template issues.

**Section 7: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Procedures**
   - **Not Applicable.** This assistant operates with no human in the loop by design. Failures are logged and escalated, but individual emails are not routed for human review before sending.

**Section 8: Maintenance & Updates**
   8.1. **Update Frequency for these Guidelines:** Annually or when significant changes to email sending infrastructure or compliance requirements occur.
   8.2. **Key Contacts for Issues/Updates:** System Operations, Marketing Automation Team.
   8.3. **Monitoring & Performance Review:** KPIs (Section 1.4) and error rates reviewed weekly/monthly. Suppression list growth and bounce rates monitored continuously.

**Section 9: Dependencies on Proprietary Systems (e.g., AirQ)**
   9.1. **Interaction with AirQ OS:** Mcp Email (No Human in the Loop) might be managed as a service within AirQ, benefiting from its reliability, scalability, and secure credential management. AirQ could also enforce network policies for accessing the email gateway.
   9.2. **Data Handling within AirQ:** Logs, recipient data, and template variables processed by this assistant, if managed through AirQ, must adhere to AirQâ€™s data handling, encryption, and audit trail requirements. AirQ could provide a secure vault for API keys.
