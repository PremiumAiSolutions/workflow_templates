**Section 6: Error Handling & Escalation Procedures**
   6.1. **Common Error Scenarios & Codes:**
       - `ERR_INTENT_UNCLEAR`: AI cannot confidently determine the inquirer's need.
       - `ERR_KB_NO_ANSWER`: Mcp KB does not have the requested information.
       - `ERR_TRANSFER_FAILED`: Call/chat transfer could not be completed.
       - `ERR_CALENDAR_UNAVAILABLE`: Mcp Calendar service not responding for scheduling.
       - `ERR_STAFF_UNAVAILABLE`: Requested staff member is not available and no alternative action defined.
   6.2. **Automated Resolution Steps:**
       - For `ERR_INTENT_UNCLEAR`: Ask clarifying questions (up to `max_clarification_attempts`).
       - For `ERR_KB_NO_ANSWER`: Inform the user the information isn't readily available and offer to route to a human or take a message.
   6.3. **Escalation Path:**
       - If intent remains unclear after clarification attempts or if AI confidence is below `trigger_on_low_intent_confidence_score`: Escalate to `escalation_queue_phone` or `escalation_queue_chat` (human receptionist).
       - If a critical service (Telephony, Chat, Mcp KB) is down: Notify System Operations and potentially switch to a limited service mode or after-hours message.
       - If a caller is abusive or threatening: Follow company policy for handling difficult callers (may involve direct escalation to security or a manager).

**Section 7: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Procedures**
   7.1. **Criteria for Triggering HITL:** (As defined in Section 6.3 and configuration)
       - Low intent confidence score.
       - Exceeded maximum clarification attempts.
       - Inquirer explicitly requests to speak to a human.
       - Specific complex scenarios pre-defined for human handling.
   7.2. **Information to Provide to Human Reviewer (Human Receptionist):**
       - Interaction ID, channel, caller/visitor ID, transcript of the interaction so far, AI's interpretation of intent (if any), reason for escalation.
   7.3. **Process for Incorporating Human Feedback/Decision:**
       - Human receptionist takes over the live interaction (call/chat) or handles the escalated task.
   7.4. **Learning from HITL:**
       - Log all HITL instances and reasons.
       - Periodically review escalated interactions to identify patterns for improving NLU models, FAQ content in Mcp KB, or routing logic.

**Section 8: Maintenance & Updates**
   8.1. **Update Frequency for these Guidelines:** Quarterly, or as company contact procedures, staff directory, or service offerings change.
   8.2. **Key Contacts for Issues/Updates:** Front Office Support Manager, AI Development Team.
   8.3. **Monitoring & Performance Review:** KPIs (Section 1.4) reviewed monthly. Interaction logs and escalation rates reviewed weekly.

**Section 9: Dependencies on Proprietary Systems (e.g., AirQ)**
   9.1. **Interaction with AirQ OS:** Mcp Receptionist may run on AirQ infrastructure, leveraging its secure communication channels for telephony and chat integrations. AirQ could provide advanced NLU capabilities or manage the state of interactions across different channels.
   9.2. **Data Handling within AirQ:** All interaction data, PII, call logs, and chat transcripts processed or stored via AirQ must adhere to its strict data governance, encryption, and audit trail requirements. AirQ could ensure that sensitive interaction details are only accessible by authorized personnel or systems.
