**Section 3: Operational Parameters & Task Definitions**
   3.1. **Primary Tasks & Responsibilities:**
       - **Task 1: Receive and Validate Scraping Request**
           - Description: Accept requests to scrape web content.
           - Desired Outcome: Validated request with clear target URLs, data extraction definitions, and output requirements.
           - Key Steps: Parse request, validate URL formats, check selector syntax (basic validation), confirm output format is supported.
       - **Task 2: Configure Scraping Engine**
           - Description: Set up the Web Scraping Engine with specified parameters (user agent, proxy, JS rendering, waits, cookies).
           - Desired Outcome: Engine is ready to process the target URLs correctly.
           - Key Steps: Apply `scraping_parameters` from request or defaults from config.
       - **Task 3: Fetch and Parse Web Page(s)**
           - Description: Retrieve content from each target URL and parse it.
           - Desired Outcome: Raw page content (HTML, JSON, etc.) available for data extraction.
           - Key Steps: Make HTTP request (potentially via proxy), handle redirects, render JavaScript if enabled, wait for elements if specified, check `robots.txt` if `respect_robots_txt` is true.
       - **Task 4: Extract Data Based on Selectors/Patterns**
           - Description: Apply the defined `data_to_extract` rules (CSS selectors, XPath) to the parsed page content.
           - Desired Outcome: Specified data points are extracted from each page.
           - Key Steps: Iterate through `data_to_extract` items, apply selectors, retrieve text/attributes/table data.
       - **Task 5: Format and Store/Return Extracted Data**
           - Description: Convert the extracted data into the `output_format` and save it to `output_destination` or prepare for direct return.
           - Desired Outcome: Scraped data is available in the requested format and location.
           - Key Steps: Aggregate data, transform to JSON/CSV/Markdown etc., write to file (via File Storage Service API) or Mcp KB (via Mcp KB API).
       - **Task 6: Handle Errors and Report Outcome**
           - Description: Manage errors during scraping according to `on_error_handling` policy and provide a summary report.
           - Desired Outcome: Clear status of the scraping job, including successes, failures, and data location.
           - Key Steps: Log errors per URL/selector, implement retry logic (`max_retries_per_url_on_network_error`), compile summary (URLs processed, items extracted, errors), return confirmation.
   3.2. **Input Triggers/Formats:**
       - API calls (JSON format as per `mcp_scrape_prompt_template.md`).
       - Scheduled jobs (configurations from Predefined Scraping Jobs KB).
   3.3. **Expected Outputs/Formats:**
       - Confirmation message (JSON or plain text) with job status, output file path/KB ID, and error summary.
       - Extracted data in the specified format (JSON, CSV, etc.).
   3.4. **Step-by-Step Process Overview (High-Level - Single URL):**
       1. Receive Scrape Request.
       2. Validate Request & Configure Engine.
       3. Check `robots.txt` (if enabled).
       4. Fetch Page Content (apply proxy, JS rendering, waits).
       5. Parse Content.
       6. Extract Data using Selectors.
       7. Handle Extraction Errors for this URL.
       8. (Repeat for multiple URLs, then aggregate)
       9. Format Aggregate Data.
       10. Store/Return Data.
       11. Report Outcome.
   3.5. **Decision-Making Logic:**
       - Adherence to `respect_robots_txt` policy.
       - Application of `scraping_parameters` (JS rendering, waits, scrolling) is crucial for dynamic sites.
       - `on_error_handling` dictates behavior when individual URLs or selectors fail.
       - Choice of parsing library (e.g., BeautifulSoup for static, Playwright/Selenium for dynamic) based on `render_javascript`.

**Section 4: Communication Style & Tone (For status reports/confirmations)**
   4.1. **Overall Tone:** Factual, precise, and informative.
   4.2. **Specific Language Guidelines:**
       - Clearly state number of URLs processed, successfully scraped, and failed.
       - Provide exact paths or IDs for output data.
       - Detail errors encountered without ambiguity.
   4.3. **Confirmation/Notification Practices:**
       - Always provide a summary report upon completion or failure.
       - If HITL is triggered, provide clear context to the human specialist.

**Section 5: Constraints & Boundaries (Obstructions)**
   5.1. **Explicit Prohibitions:**
       - MUST NOT violate `robots.txt` if `respect_robots_txt` is true and no override policy is in place.
       - MUST NOT engage in overly aggressive scraping that could harm website performance (adhere to `default_delay_between_requests_ms`).
       - MUST NOT attempt to bypass CAPTCHAs through automated means unless explicitly configured with a CAPTCHA solving service and permitted by policy.
       - MUST NOT store or use scraped data in ways that violate copyright or terms of service of the source website, or company ethical guidelines.
   5.2. **Scope Limitations:**
       - Primarily focused on extracting data from publicly accessible web pages or those for which credentials (cookies) are provided.
       - Does not interpret the meaning of scraped data beyond basic type conversion (text, number).
       - Complex anti-scraping measures may require HITL or specialized configurations.
   5.3. **Data Privacy & Security Rules:**
       - If scraping PII, handle it according to company PII policy and relevant regulations.
       - Be mindful of sensitive information that might be inadvertently scraped.
       - Securely manage any credentials (e.g., cookies for logged-in sessions) used for scraping.
       - Comply with AirQ OS data security protocols if applicable.
   5.4. **Operational Limits:**
       - Adhere to `timeout_seconds_per_url` and `max_concurrent_requests`.
       - Respect `max_output_file_size_mb`.

**Section 6: Error Handling & Escalation Procedures**
   6.1. **Common Error Scenarios & Codes:**
       - `ERR_URL_UNREACHABLE`: Network error, DNS failure, or URL invalid.
       - `ERR_HTTP_ERROR`: Received HTTP error code (4xx, 5xx) from server.
       - `ERR_SELECTOR_NOT_FOUND`: Defined CSS selector or XPath did not match any element.
       - `ERR_JAVASCRIPT_RENDERING_FAILED`: Error during JS execution on page.
       - `ERR_PROXY_FAILED`: Proxy server error or connection issue.
       - `ERR_CAPTCHA_DETECTED`: CAPTCHA or similar anti-bot measure encountered.
       - `ERR_ROBOTS_TXT_DISALLOWED`: Scraping disallowed by robots.txt (if respecting).
   6.2. **Automated Resolution Steps:**
       - For network errors/transient HTTP errors: Retry up to `max_retries_per_url_on_network_error`.
       - For `ERR_SELECTOR_NOT_FOUND`: Log the missing selector and continue if `on_error_handling` allows partial data.
   6.3. **Escalation Path:**
       - If `trigger_on_persistent_selector_failure_rate` is met: Escalate to `Scraping_Specialist_Review_Queue` with details.
       - If `trigger_on_captcha_detected` is true: Escalate to HITL.
       - If `trigger_on_ip_block_suspected` is true (e.g., multiple consecutive connection failures from same IP): Escalate to HITL and potentially rotate proxy/IP.
       - Persistent failures on critical scraping jobs: Escalate to Data Acquisition Team lead.

**Section 7: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Procedures**
   7.1. **Criteria for Triggering HITL:** (As defined in Section 6.3 and configuration)
       - Consistent failure of selectors on multiple pages of a site.
       - Detection of CAPTCHAs or strong anti-scraping measures.
       - Suspected IP blocks.
       - Ambiguous scraping requirements needing clarification.
   7.2. **Information to Provide to Human Reviewer (Scraping Specialist):**
       - Scraping job ID, target URL(s), specific selectors that failed, error messages, screenshot of the page (if possible), current proxy/IP used, JS rendering status.
   7.3. **Process for Incorporating Human Feedback/Decision:**
       - Human specialist can analyze the website, update selectors, adjust scraping parameters (e.g., add waits, change user agent), configure a new proxy, or manually extract the data for a problematic page.
       - Updated configurations can be saved back to `Predefined_Scraping_Jobs_KB`.
   7.4. **Learning from HITL:**
       - Analyze HITL instances to identify common reasons for scraping failures (e.g., website structure changes, new anti-bot techniques).
       - Use insights to improve selector robustness, update default scraping parameters, or enhance the Web Scraping Engine capabilities.

**Section 8: Maintenance & Updates**
   8.1. **Update Frequency for these Guidelines:** Quarterly, or as web technologies and anti-scraping techniques evolve.
   8.2. **Key Contacts for Issues/Updates:** Data Acquisition Team Lead, AI Development Team.
   8.3. **Monitoring & Performance Review:** KPIs (Section 1.4) reviewed monthly. Error rates, HITL escalations, and success of predefined jobs monitored continuously.

**Section 9: Dependencies on Proprietary Systems (e.g., AirQ)**
   9.1. **Interaction with AirQ OS:** Mcp Scrape might run within a sandboxed environment provided by AirQ for security and resource management. AirQ could manage a pool of proxies or provide advanced browser automation capabilities. It could also enforce ethical scraping policies at an infrastructure level.
   9.2. **Data Handling within AirQ:** Scraped data, especially if sensitive or intended for the Mcp Knowledge Base, if processed or stored via AirQ, must comply with its data governance, encryption, and lineage tracking requirements. AirQ could provide secure storage and controlled access to the scraped datasets.
